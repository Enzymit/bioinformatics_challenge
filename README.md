# Welcome to Enzymit's Grand Challenge!

## Background
Today you will help us investigate [Polyphosphate Glucokinases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphosphate%E2%80%94glucose_phosphotransferase). These are enzymes that can catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose with polyphosphates. Most kinases, perform phosphorylation reactions with ATP, which is an expensive co-factor that imposes high costs on phosphorylation reactions in industrial settings. Having the ability to utilize polyphosphates for phosphorylation reactions can dramatically lower costs of many chemical reactions that are currently not cost effective.
